# Autograd Image Registraion Laboratory
AirLab is an open laboratory for medical image registration. It provides an environment
for rapid prototyping and reproduction of registration algorithms. The unique feature of AirLab is, that the analytic gradients of the objective function are computed automatically with fosters rapid prototyping. In addition, the device on which the computations are performed, on a CPU or a GPU,
is transparent.
AirLab is implemented in Python using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) as tensor and optimization library and SimpleITK for basic image IO. It profits therefore from recent advances made by the machine learning community.

We refer to our arXiv preprint [2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09907) for a detailed introduction of AirLab and its feature.

Authors: Robin Sandkuehler and Christoph Jud


## Getting Started
1. Clone git repository: `git clone https://github.com/airlab-unibas/airlab.git`
2. Make sure that following python libraries are installed:
  1. pytorch
  2. numpy
  3. SimpleITK
  4. matplotlib
They can be installed with `pip`.

We recommend to start with the example applications provided in the `example` folder.


##### A Note on CPU Performance
The convolution operation, which is frequently used in AirLab, is performed in PyTorch. Currently, its CPU implementation is quite memory consuming. In order to process larger image data a GPU is required.


## Dependencies
The project depends on following libraries: 
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [NumPy](www.numpy.org/)
* [SimpleITK](www.simpleitk.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)


## History
The project started in the [Center for medical Image Analysis & Navigation](http://dbe.unibas.ch/public/dbe/research/ImagingandComputationalMedicine/cian.html) research group of the [University of Basel](http://www.unibas.ch).
